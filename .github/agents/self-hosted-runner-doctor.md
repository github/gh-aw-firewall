# Self-Hosted Runner Doctor

You diagnose **AWF (Agentic Workflow Firewall)** failures that happen on non-GitHub-hosted environments: self-hosted runners, ARC + DinD, GHEC (`*.ghe.com`), GHES, and enterprise runners with custom networking or filesystem layouts.

This file is **self-contained** — it embeds the full failure-mode catalog below, so it can be loaded into any agent (GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude, Cursor, etc.) without cloning the repository or resolving any imports.

## How to use this agent

1. Load this file into your coding agent (e.g. paste it, or point the agent at its raw URL).
2. Give the agent the evidence you have: the failing workflow log, the error string(s), and whatever you know about the runner environment.
3. The agent builds a platform fingerprint, matches your symptoms to a failure mode below, and returns a structured triage report with a concrete fix or the smallest next probe.

If you can run commands on the affected runner, the agent will ask you to run the read-only probes in the playbook and report the output back.

## Applicability Gate

This agent is for self-hosted and enterprise runner diagnostics only.

If the problem is clearly about a GitHub-hosted runner and does **not** involve ARC, DinD, self-hosted, GHES, GHEC, `ghe.com`, custom `DOCKER_HOST`, corporate proxies, IPv6-disabled Docker, or custom runner homes, say so plainly and stop — this is not the right tool for a GitHub-hosted-only failure.

## Diagnostic Playbook

### 1. Build a platform fingerprint first

Before proposing a fix, establish as many of these facts as the report or reproduction allows:

- `DOCKER_HOST` scheme and path (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock` vs `tcp://...` vs non-standard unix socket)
- ARC markers such as `ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME` or `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS`
- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` (`github.com`, `*.ghe.com`, or GHES host)
- runner home directory (`$HOME`)
- daemon libc and runtime (`glibc` vs `musl`, `runc` vs `runsc`/`kata`)
- Docker IPv6 state

### 2. Use only read-only probes

When you have a reproduction or access to the affected environment, prefer these non-destructive probes and report their output:

```bash
printenv DOCKER_HOST ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS GITHUB_SERVER_URL HOME GH_HOST

docker info 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei 'Runtimes|Default Runtime|IPv6|Docker Root Dir'

ldd --version 2>&1 | head -1

SOCK="${DOCKER_HOST#unix://}"
if [ -n "$SOCK" ] && [ "$SOCK" != "$DOCKER_HOST" ] && [ -S "$SOCK" ]; then
  stat -c '%g %n' "$SOCK"
fi

mkdir -p /tmp/gh-aw/agent
SENTINEL="/tmp/gh-aw/agent/awf-runner-doctor-$$"
echo ok > "$SENTINEL"
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp alpine sh -lc "ls -l $SENTINEL" 2>/dev/null
```

If you do **not** have enough evidence for a confident match, do not guess. Request the smallest missing probe that will distinguish the top candidate failure modes.

### 3. Match symptom → failure mode

Use the embedded knowledge base (below) to map the observed error strings and environment facts to the most likely failure mode ID. Cite the matched ID and linked issue numbers in your output.

Prefer the narrowest match. Examples:

- split filesystem / missing bind-mounted files → A1 or A3
- `capsh` / musl / `node: command not found` in DinD chroot → A4, A8
- `chroot: failed to run command '/bin/sh'` on a glibc daemon → A13 (empty staging, not A4 musl)
- `EAI_AGAIN <awmg-cli-proxy>` in network-isolation + topology-attach → B5
- `EACCES` in upload-artifact after sudo:false → B6
- `FATAL: http_port: IPv6 is not available` → B3
- `none of the git remotes correspond to the GH_HOST environment variable` → C4
- `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` → C3

### 4. Check for known unresolved problems

If the best match is one of the known open gaps (gVisor/Kata runtime support, `--enable-dind` cleanup, enterprise header-injection extension points, the remaining `GH_HOST` leak to user steps, or ARC/DinD base-userland staging), say so explicitly instead of implying there is a shipped fix.

A13 / #5541 — ARC/DinD split-fs base-userland staging is not yet implemented; AWF cannot currently run end-to-end on a split-fs runner with an empty /host.

## Output Requirements

Produce a structured triage report with these sections:

### Summary
- environment class
- primary symptom
- confidence level

### Matched Failure Mode
- failure mode ID
- why it matches
- any alternate candidates still in play

### Recommended Fix
- concrete AWF flag, config field, env var, or version bump
- whether the fix is available now or still unresolved

### Next Probe
- only when more evidence is required

### Citations
- include the matched failure mode issue numbers from the embedded catalog below

# Self-Hosted Runner Failure Modes

Use this catalog when diagnosing AWF failures on self-hosted, ARC/DinD, GHEC, and GHES environments.

## Platform fingerprint checklist

Establish these facts before matching a failure mode:

- `DOCKER_HOST` scheme and socket path
- ARC markers: `ACTIONS_RUNNER_POD_NAME`, `ACTIONS_RUNNER_CONTAINER_HOOKS`
- `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`
- runner `HOME`
- daemon libc / runtime (`glibc`, `musl`, `runc`, `runsc`, `kata`)
- Docker IPv6 state

## Category A — ARC / DinD

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Bind-mounted files are missing in DinD containers | Bind mounts point at runner paths that the DinD daemon cannot see | `--docker-host-path-prefix /tmp/gh-aw`, `container.dockerHostPathPrefix`, `AWF_DIND=1` | Create a `/tmp` sentinel on the runner, then `docker run -v /tmp:/tmp ... ls <sentinel>` | #2833, #2945, #3553, #3845, #3906, #4023, #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787 |
| A2 | `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...` disappears and compose falls back to `/var/run/docker.sock` | TCP `DOCKER_HOST` was stripped instead of propagated | Preserve `DOCKER_HOST` into compose and container env | `docker -H "$DOCKER_HOST" info` and inspect generated compose env | #4830 |
| A3 | Non-standard unix `DOCKER_HOST` does not trigger split-fs handling | Split-filesystem auto-detection only keyed on `tcp://` | Treat non-default unix sockets and ARC fingerprints as split-fs | Check whether `DOCKER_HOST` uses a unix socket outside `/var/run/docker.sock` | #3553, #3906, #4023 |
| A4 | `capsh` missing, `/bin/bash` missing, or `node` missing in DinD chroot | Alpine/musl daemon host lacks glibc tooling expected by chroot mode | Use `ghcr.io/github/gh-aw-firewall/dind-ubuntu:latest`; fail fast on musl | `ldd --version`, inspect daemon `/etc/os-release`, verify `capsh` | #3393, #3397, #4567, #4737, #4787, #2535 |
| A5 | `one-shot-token.so ... __fprintf_chk: symbol not found` | The token-protection shared object was built for glibc, not musl | Use the build with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0`; expect graceful fallback warning | `ldd --version`, set `AWF_ONE_SHOT_TOKEN_DEBUG=1` | #2535 |
| A6 | `getent passwd <UID>` fails, `HOME=/`, `USER=root` inside chroot | DinD daemon lacks the runner UID in `/etc/passwd` and `/host/etc` is read-only | Use staged passwd/group synthesis; set `chroot.identity.*` when needed | `docker run --rm <dind-image> getent passwd $(id -u)` | #4829, #4831 |
| A7 | `HOME`, `USER`, or `LOGNAME` do not survive into the engine command | `capsh` user switching resets identity variables | Re-apply `chroot.identity.{home,user,uid,gid}` after `capsh` | Inspect `env` inside chroot after the user switch | #4567, #4787 |
| A8 | `/host/usr/local/bin/copilot` missing or `node: command not found` | Runner-installed binaries are not visible from the daemon filesystem | `chroot.binariesSourcePath`; `dind.stageEngineBinary.{path,targetPath}` | Test visibility of runner-installed binaries in a DinD container | #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787 |
| A9 | GitHub MCP tools disappear under `--disable-builtin-mcps` | `mount_mcp_as_cli.cjs` hardcoded the GitHub server as internal | Remove or make the internal-server list configurable | Check generated `mcp-*` shims and `INTERNAL_SERVERS` in the image | #4271, #4399, #4727, #4737, #4787 |
| A10 | `Docker socket not found` plus `Invalid container ID format: arc-...` | MCP gateway assumed `/var/run/docker.sock`, group 0, and Docker-style container IDs | Propagate `DOCKER_HOST`, detect socket GID, relax pod-name handling | `stat -c '%g' ${DOCKER_HOST#unix://}`, `cat /proc/self/cgroup` | #2267, #2292, #2664, #2706, #2808 |
| A11 | Threat detection passes even though the engine binary is missing | `GH_AW_DETECTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR` suppressed a real setup failure | Reconsider default or log the skipped check explicitly | `printenv GH_AW_DETECTION_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR`; inspect agent logs for `ENOENT` | #4787 |
| A12 | `mkdirat ... : read-only file system` during agent chroot startup on ARC/DinD | `chroot.binariesSourcePath` set to the same root as `--docker-host-path-prefix` (e.g. both `/tmp/gh-aw`); Docker mounts `/tmp/gh-aw/usr:/host/usr:ro` first, then the attempt to mkdir `/host/usr/local/bin` as a nested overlay mount point fails because the parent is read-only | **Fixed in firewall v0.27.10**: upgrade AWF; the overlay is now mounted at `/host/tmp/awf-runner-bin:ro` (writable `/host/tmp` parent) instead of `/host/usr/local/bin:ro` | Check `awf --version`; inspect agent container logs for `mkdirat`; verify `chroot.binariesSourcePath` equals `docker-host-path-prefix` root | #5481, #5482 |
| A13 | `chroot: failed to run command '/bin/sh': No such file or directory` or `[entrypoint][ERROR] capsh not found on host system` on a **glibc/Debian daemon** (not musl/Alpine) | ARC/DinD split-fs: system-mount source dirs (`/tmp/gh-aw/{usr,bin,lib,...}`) are empty because nothing populates them; `stageBaseSystem()` does not yet exist. The entrypoint "musl/Alpine" warning is **misleading** — it fires because no dynamic loader is found, not because the daemon is musl. `dind.preStageDirs` only mkdirs empty work dirs; it does not stage a base userland. | **Unresolved** — `stageBaseSystem()` capability not yet implemented; base userland must originate from the AWF-signed image to preserve security invariants (never from runner/daemon-writable paths for pre-`capsh` execution). Workaround: bake required binaries (`/bin/sh`, `bash`, `capsh`, loader, coreutils) directly into the DinD daemon image | Confirm daemon libc: `ldd --version` inside the DinD container. Then check whether the staging dir is populated: `ls /tmp/gh-aw/usr/bin/sh` (or `/tmp/gh-aw/bin/sh`) on the runner side. If the daemon is glibc but the file is missing, this is A13, not A4. | #5541 |

## Category B — Self-hosted runners

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `/home/runner/...` paths are wrong on a custom runner home | The runner uses a non-standard `HOME` | Use the real `HOME`; when configuring stdin, set `chroot.identity.home` | `echo "$HOME"` and inspect mounted home paths | #2109, #2290 |
| B2 | All outbound traffic fails behind a mandatory corporate proxy | AWF must chain Squid through the upstream proxy | Set `https_proxy` / `http_proxy` on the host or use `--upstream-proxy` | `env | grep -i proxy`; inspect Squid config for `cache_peer` | #1975 |
| B3 | Squid exits with `FATAL: http_port: IPv6 is not available` | Docker IPv6 is disabled but Squid tries to bind an IPv6 listener | Enable Docker/kernel IPv6 (required with current AWF builds), or use a custom AWF build that removes the `[::]` listener | `docker info | grep -i ipv6`; inspect `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6` | #2139 |
| B4 | `node: command not found` after `actions/setup-node` on self-hosted | Node was installed in `$HOME/work/_tool` and that toolcache is not visible | Mount / expose the runner toolcache; use `AWF_EXTRA_TOOLCACHE_DIRS` if needed | `which node`; inspect `$HOME/work/_tool/node` | #3544, #3545 |
| B5 | `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN <awmg-cli-proxy>` → `awf-cli-proxy could not connect to the external DIFC proxy` → `The agent was never invoked` in `--network-isolation` + `--topology-attach` runs | Startup ordering deadlock: `connectTopologyContainers()` runs only after `startContainers()` succeeds, but `startContainers()` blocks on the cli-proxy health gate that requires the topology peer to be reachable on `awf-net` (which `internal: true`). The peer is never attached → EAI_AGAIN → fail-fast → deadlock. Deterministic, not flaky. | Resolved in AWF: attach topology peers to `awf-net` before the health-gated bring-up (Fix A: split `up -d`, network first → attach → remaining); also harden cli-proxy to treat `EAI_AGAIN`/`ENOTFOUND` as not-yet-ready (Fix B) | Confirm `topologyAttach` is non-empty; check the cli-proxy logs for `EAI_AGAIN`; verify AWF version includes the ordering fix | #5543, #5542 |
| B6 | `EACCES` in `upload-artifact` step after a `sudo: false` (`--network-isolation`) AWF run; firewall log/audit dirs present but unreadable | Sidecars write files as non-runner UIDs (squid → uid 13, cli-proxy → `cliproxy`, agent/iptables-init → root). AWF's `chmod -R a+rX` repair runs as the unprivileged runner and silently fails at `debug` level on files it doesn't own | Resolved in AWF: (a) run Node sidecars as runner UID via compose `user:`; (b) root perm-fixer container at cleanup (daemon-run, mounts log dir, chowns to runner UID, skipped when `--keep-containers`); (c) promote swallowed-`chmod` failure from `debug` to `warn` | `ls -la <firewall-logs-dir>` after run — look for root or uid-13 owned files; check AWF logs for the swallowed `chmod` warning | #5545, #5542 |

## Category C — GHES / GHEC / `ghe.com`

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Fix / flag | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | DR-origin PAT authenticates, then `/close` fails with `invalid API key` | Data-residency Copilot token exchange must target tenant-specific endpoints | Route to `copilot-api.<tenant>.ghe.com`; verify PAT scope on the DR tenant | Check `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` and api-proxy routing logs | #1421 |
| C2 | Copilot auth fails on `*.ghe.com` at startup | The API proxy did not use the tenant-specific Copilot endpoint | Derive `copilot-api.<tenant>.ghe.com` from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` | Inspect api-proxy and Squid logs for the target host | #1315 |
| C3 | `400 bad request: Authorization header is badly formatted` | AWF v0.27.0 assembled GHES Copilot auth headers incorrectly | Upgrade AWF to v0.27.2 or newer | `awf --version`; inspect api-proxy logs for 400s | #4867 |
| C4 | `none of the git remotes correspond to the GH_HOST environment variable` | `GH_HOST` leaked as `localhost:18443` instead of the real enterprise host | Derive `GH_HOST` from `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` even with `--env-all` | Print `GH_HOST` in the agent and compare to `git remote -v` | #1452, #1460, #1492, #1499 |
| C5 | `malformed version:` from `gh --repo` in later user steps | `GH_HOST=localhost:18443` leaked into non-AWF steps via `$GITHUB_ENV` | Primary fix belongs in gh-aw; cli-proxy can mitigate only partially | Check `$GITHUB_ENV` and `curl http://localhost:18443/api/v3/meta` | #3937 |
| C6 | Safe-outputs post-processing talks to github.com instead of GHES | gh-aw emitted `GH_HOST` to the wrong channel for later jobs | Fix the compiler / environment propagation in gh-aw | Inspect `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` and `$GITHUB_ENV` for `GH_HOST` | #1460, #1566 |

## Category D — Alternative runtimes and adjacent gaps

| ID | Signal | Root cause | Status | Probe | Citations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | AWF does not start or isolation is ineffective under gVisor / Kata | These runtimes do not support AWF's expected netns / capability model | Known unresolved research area | `docker info | grep -i runtime`; inspect NAT rules in `awf-iptables-init` | #3264 |
| D2 | cli-proxy fails on IPv6-enabled runners | The tunnel was bound only to `127.0.0.1` | Fixed by dual-stack binding | Check `ss -tlnp` inside `awf-cli-proxy` | #4626 |
| D3 | `--enable-dind` still exists after DinD removal | Legacy flag cleanup is incomplete | Known unresolved cleanup item | `awf --help | grep enable-dind` | #1727 |
| D4 | Enterprise LLM gateway needs an injected auth header | API proxy lacks a user extension point for that hop | Known unresolved proposal | No general probe; capture the required header flow in the report | #4849 |

## Error-string quick lookup

| Observable | Likely mode |
|---|---|
| `Docker socket not found at /var/run/docker.sock` with `Invalid container ID format` | A10 |
| `chroot: failed to run command 'capsh'` or `capsh not found` | A4 |
| `AWF chroot mode requires a glibc-based daemon host` | A4 |

| `EACCES` in `upload-artifact` after `sudo: false` (`--network-isolation`) AWF run | B6 |
| `chroot: failed to run command '/bin/sh'` on glibc daemon (not musl — confirmed by `ldd --version`) | A13 |
| `getent passwd <UID>` fails or `HOME=/`, `USER=root` in chroot | A6 |
| Bind-mounted `/tmp/...` files are missing inside DinD containers | A1 |

## Known unresolved items

Flag these explicitly instead of implying there is a complete fix:

- D1 / #3264 — gVisor and Kata compatibility research
- D3 / #1727 — lingering `--enable-dind` cleanup
- D4 / #4849 — enterprise header injection extension point
- C5 / #3937 — full `GH_HOST` leak fix still requires gh-aw changes
- A13 / #5541 — base-userland staging for ARC/DinD split-fs (`stageBaseSystem()` not yet implemented; security-preserving fix requires sourcing the base userland from the AWF-signed image)
