# Smoke Test: Copilot Engine Validation

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST call `add_comment` on pull_request triggers. This is the primary success criterion. Do this FIRST before any other analysis.**

**Keep all outputs extremely short and concise. Use single-line responses where possible. No verbose explanations.**

## Pre-Computed Test Results

The following tests were already executed in a deterministic pre-agent step. Your job is to verify the results and produce the summary comment.

### 1. GitHub MCP Testing
Verify MCP connectivity by calling `github-list_pull_requests` for ${{ github.repository }} (limit 1, state merged). Confirm the result matches the pre-fetched data below.

### 2. GitHub.com Connectivity
Pre-step result: HTTP ${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_HTTP_CODE }} from github.com.
✅ if HTTP 200 or 301, ❌ otherwise.

### 3. File Write/Read Test
Pre-step wrote and read back: "${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_FILE_CONTENT }}"
File path: ${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_FILE_PATH }}
Verify by running `cat` on the file path using bash to confirm it exists.

## Pre-Fetched PR Data

```
${{ steps.smoke-data.outputs.SMOKE_PR_DATA }}
```

## Output (MANDATORY)

**If triggered by a pull request** (check: `${{ github.event_name }}` equals "pull_request"), you MUST call `add_comment` to post a **very brief** comment (max 5-10 lines) on the current pull request with:
- PR titles only (no descriptions)
- ✅ or ❌ for each test result
- Overall status: PASS or FAIL
- Mention the pull request author and any assignees

If all tests pass on a pull request trigger:
- Use the `add_labels` safe-output tool to add the label `smoke-copilot` to the pull request

**If triggered by workflow_dispatch or schedule** (no PR context), call `noop` with a concise PASS/FAIL summary instead. Do NOT attempt to add pull request comments or labels when there is no pull request.
