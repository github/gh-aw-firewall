## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Must be running for integration tests
- **Node.js**: v20.19.0+ and npm
- **Root/Sudo Access**: Required for testing iptables functionality
- **Git**: For version control

### Build Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to dist/
- `npm run dev` - Watch mode (rebuilds on changes)
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run lint` - Lint TypeScript files
- `npm run clean` - Clean build artifacts

## 📝 How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues
- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs
- Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- Include version information (`awf --version`)
- Include Docker version (`docker --version`)
- Include relevant log output (use `--log-level debug`)

### Suggesting Features
- Open an issue describing your feature request
- Explain the use case and how it would benefit users
- Include examples if applicable

### Contributing Code

#### Code Style
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use `npm run lint` to check code style
- Ensure all tests pass (`npm test`)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

#### Logging
When adding log output, always use the logger from `src/logger.ts`:

```typescript
import { logger } from './logger';

// Use appropriate log levels
logger.info('Starting operation...');
logger.debug('Configuration details:', config);
logger.warn('Potential issue detected');
logger.error('Operation failed:', error);
logger.success('Operation completed successfully');
```

#### File Organization
- Prefer creating new files grouped by functionality over adding to existing files
- Place core logic in `src/`
- Place container configurations in `containers/`
- Place CI/CD scripts in `scripts/ci/`
- Add tests alongside your code (e.g., `feature.ts` and `feature.test.ts`)

### Documentation
- Update documentation for any new features
- Add examples where helpful
- Ensure documentation is clear and concise

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass (`npm test`)
- Test manually with Docker containers when possible
- Integration tests require sudo access for iptables
